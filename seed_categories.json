In this first prototype phase we implemented two different meditation techniques – the body awareness and point focus exercises. In addition to the original project plan, an additional feature was developed for the environment: EEG based neuroadaptivity so that the environment is responsive to changes in the users brainwaves. Based on states of relaxation and focused attention measured from the brainwaves, the users avatar could levitate in the environment. The purpose of this neuroadaptivity is to boost the effects of the exercise and make the environment more responsive and immersive. It also provided feedback to the user and guided the meditation",
